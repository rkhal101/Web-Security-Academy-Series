## GraphQL bug discovery techniques

* **You need to get gql introspection to work**
[Introspection info on OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/12-API_Testing/01-Testing_GraphQL)

* **Export that to gql voyager (can do it online)**
[graphql-voyager online](https://graphql-kit.com/graphql-voyager/)
[GraphQL-Voyager GitHub Repo](https://graphql-kit.com/graphql-voyager/)
  

* **Then that will give u a graphic representation**

* **Then u follow the white rabbit**

* **And use that to privesc up**

* **Look at the relationships between the objects and there's no telling what you will find**

* **This is a very manual process, but it enables priv esc**

* **Think SQLi (GraphQL is a query language, so there's some similar mental paradigms)**
