### **What is Session Fixation?**

**Session Fixation** is a type of web application vulnerability where an attacker tricks a victim into using a session identifier (session ID) chosen by the attacker. Once the victim authenticates using the fixed session ID, the attacker can use it to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their account or data.

---

### **How Does Session Fixation Work?**

Session fixation exploits the session management mechanism of a web application, particularly when:

- The application allows a session ID to remain valid after the user authenticates.
- The application does not generate a new session ID upon successful login.

#### **Steps of Session Fixation:**

1. **Attacker Obtains a Session ID:**
    
    - The attacker creates or predicts a valid session ID (e.g., by initiating a session themselves).
2. **Attacker Fixes the Session ID:**
    
    - The attacker delivers the session ID to the victim through various means:
        - **URL:** `https://example.com/login?sessionID=123456`
        - **Hidden Form Fields:** Embedding the session ID in an HTML form.
        - **Cookies:** Using client-side scripts or other injection techniques.
3. **Victim Logs In with the Fixed Session ID:**
    
    - The victim authenticates using the fixed session ID.
4. **Attacker Gains Access:**
    
    - The attacker uses the same session ID to gain access to the victim's authenticated session.

### **How Session Fixation Relates to Web Application Security**

Session fixation undermines the core purpose of session management, which is to uniquely identify and authenticate users during their interactions with a web application. If exploited, it can lead to:

- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker can impersonate a legitimate user.
- **Data Theft:** Sensitive information can be accessed.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the victim has administrative privileges, the attacker can perform high-impact actions.

### **Exploiting Session Fixation**

#### **Attack Scenarios:**

1. **Session ID in URLs:**
    
    - The attacker generates a session ID and sends the victim a URL containing it.
    - Example:
        
        ```plaintext
        https://bank.example.com/login?sessionID=abc123
        ```
        
    - When the victim logs in, the attacker reuses the same `sessionID` to hijack the session.
2. **Hidden Form Fields:**
    
    - The attacker embeds a fixed session ID in an HTML form and tricks the victim into submitting it.
3. **Cookie Injection:**
    
    - If the attacker can manipulate cookies on the victim's browser (e.g., via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)), they can set a specific session ID.
4. **Email or Phishing:**
    
    - The attacker sends a crafted link to the victim via email or phishing campaigns with the fixed session ID.

### **Defending Against Session Fixation**

#### **1. Regenerate Session IDs Upon Authentication**

- Always generate a new session ID when a user logs in.
- This ensures that any pre-existing session IDs (e.g., those fixed by an attacker) become invalid.

#### **2. Secure Cookies:**

- Use `HttpOnly` cookies to prevent client-side scripts from accessing session IDs.
- Use the `Secure` attribute to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
- Implement the `SameSite` attribute to prevent cross-origin requests from including cookies.

#### **3. Set Session Expiry:**

- Sessions should have a short expiration time to limit their usefulness if compromised.

#### **4. Avoid Including Session IDs in URLs:**

- Never pass session IDs in query strings or URLs, as they can be logged or intercepted.
- Use cookies to store session IDs securely.

#### **5. Protect Against XSS:**

- Since XSS can be used to inject cookies or steal session IDs, securing against XSS also helps mitigate session fixation attacks.

#### **6. Validate Session IDs:**

- Check the integrity of session IDs to ensure they haven't been tampered with or reused from an unauthenticated context.

### **Penetration Testing for Session Fixation**

To identify session fixation vulnerabilities during web app penetration testing:

1. **Check if Session ID Changes on Login:**
    
    - Log in and observe whether the session ID changes. If not, the application may be vulnerable.
2. **Attempt Fixation via URL:**
    
    - Predefine a session ID in the URL and check if the victimâ€™s session adopts it.
3. **Cookie Manipulation:**
    
    - Set a custom session cookie before the victim authenticates and see if it persists after login.
4. **Test for XSS:**
    
    - Look for XSS vulnerabilities that could allow the injection of fixed session IDs.
5. **Analyze Logout Behavior:**
    
    - Ensure that logging out invalidates the session ID and prevents reuse.

### **Conclusion**

Session fixation is a serious vulnerability that allows attackers to hijack user sessions and impersonate legitimate users. Proper session management, including regenerating session IDs upon authentication and securing cookies, is critical to defending against these attacks. For penetration testers, identifying and exploiting session fixation vulnerabilities is a key aspect of evaluating the robustness of session handling in web applications.
